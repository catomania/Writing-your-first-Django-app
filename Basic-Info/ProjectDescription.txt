Just text: 

This is my first time using Django! I am following the tutorial located here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/

I will be creating a basic poll application. There will be 2 parts:

1) A public site that lets people see the poll and vote
2) An admin site that lets me add, change, and delete polls
