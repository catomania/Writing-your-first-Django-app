Note taking: 

- What is the relationship between models, databases, and data?

- How to make model changes:
  * change your models in models.py
  * run python manage.py makemigrations, this will create migrations for those changes 
  * run python manage.py migrate to APPLY those changes to a database

- Why run these steps? 
Why 3 steps and not just 1 step? They are separate commands to make and apply migrations because you will commit migrations
to your version control system (make migrations) and then ship them to your app (migrate). As always, read the documentation
on manage.py

This is quite interesting! Field lookups are very similar to SQL "Where" clauses. 
basic lookups have the format of field__lookups=value
