Part 3

Views: a type of webpage
(all 4 must be in polls.urls)
1) Question index page
2) Question detail page
3) Question results page
4) Vote action page

You create views in your polls/view.py file. After you create your view, you need to configure it map it to a URL. 
So, you create a urls.py file and then you use REGULAR EXPRESSIONS! Woohoo! Url() regex arguments. In practice, you don't need to be a Regex expert, but you should know simple patterns.

Views can also take arguments. 

polls/urls.py and mysite/urls.py...both are needed!

And when they say mysite/urls.py, they are referring to the mysite/mysite folder. The outside mysite folder is just a project folder, you can name it whatever you like. 

Other views to write: detail, results, vote. After you modify views.py, you then need to also add these views into the polls.urls file. 

When someone requests a page like polls/42/, Django will load mysite.urls and finds the variable named urlpatterns and traverses the regexes in order. The includes() function here references other URLconfs. The Regex in include() end with a trailing slash, and not a $. Whenever Django gets to an includes(), it will remove the url matching part and send off the remaining part to be included in urlconf for more processing.

1) Django matches at ^polls/ in the main mysite.urls file.
2) Then, Django strips off the matching "polls/" part and sends over 42/ to polls.urls for further processing. In polls.urls, then the 42/ will match r'^(?P<question_id>[0-9]+)/$' (which matches any set of #'s followed by a /. Then it will result in a call to the detail view detail(request=<HttpRequest object>, question_id='42')

Where does question_id='42' come from? The parenthesis from r'^(?P<question_id>[0-9]+)/$' captures the text which matches this regex and sends it as an argument to the view function. ?P<question_id> defines the name that will be used to identify the matched pattern (42). [0-9]+ will match any set of #'s. 

Every view:
returns an HttpResponse object containing the content for the requested page or raising an exception (404, no page found). 

You can use Django's own database api to pull content from database and display on your website.

my project's TEMPLATES settings describes how Django will load and render templates.
default settings confgures a DjangoTemplates backend.
By convention DjangoTemplates looks for a templates subdir in each of Installed_apps
this is how django knows to find the polls templates even though we didnt modify the DIRS option

namespacing = putting templates in another dir named for the application itself polls/templates/polls/index.html. 

for index.html..what is this {%  %} stuff??

There is also a render() shortcut which takes request object, template, and dictionary as its arguments.

Raising a 404 error: need to import Http404. shortcut is using get_object_or_404 function. 

django's template system:
- uses dot-lookup syntax. {{ question.question_text}} it looks up the question object (which I made in models.py) and then if it fails, it would have tried an attribute lookup (question_text?). 

method calling occurs in teh {% for %} loop: question.choice_set.all- basically interpreted as Python code. question.choice_set.all() returns all Choice objects. Very interesting syntax here. 

important things to do:

namespace urls.py file in main mysite folder and then adjust the html of the views accordingly. 
you should also remove hard-coded URLs from your template files. instead you can use the {% url %} template tag. So <a href = "{% url ' detail' question.id %}" will refer to the url w/ the name of 'detail' in your urls.py file (in urls.py in polls).
