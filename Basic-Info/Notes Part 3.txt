Part 3

Views: a type of webpage

1) Question index page
2) Question detail page
3) Question results page
4) Vote action page

You create views in your polls/view.py file. After you create your view, you need to configure it map it to a URL. 
So, you create a urls.py file and then you use REGULAR EXPRESSIONS! Woohoo! Url() regex arguments. In practice, you don't need to be a Regex expert, but you should know simple patterns.

Views can also take arguments. 

polls/urls.py and mysite/urls.py...both are needed!
