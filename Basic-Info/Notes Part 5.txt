Automated tests: simple routines that check code operation

Can range from tiny detail -> overall operation of the software. 

You create a set of tests once, and then as you make changes to your app, you check that your code still works as intended.

Why create tests? Saves time (if app grows in complexity). Prevent issues (promotes transparency). 
Makes code more attractive (other developers will trust it more). Helps teams work together. Complex apps are maintained
by teams. Tests help make sure colleagues don't break your code. 

If you want to be a good Django programmer, you must be good at writing tests!

There is even such a thing as "test driven development," tests are written before app is written.

Sometimes you should write your first test the next time you make a change (add new feature, fix a bug). 

Identify a bug in this case: Question.was_published_recently() method returns true even when publish date is in the future.
